SSH (Secure Shell) keys are a pair of cryptographic keys used for secure authentication and communication between two computers over a network. The pair consists of a private key and a public key. The private key is kept on the client-side and should be kept secret, while the public key is placed on the server-side to allow secure access.

When you connect to a remote server using SSH, the server checks if your client has the corresponding private key. If the private key matches the public key stored on the server, the authentication is successful, and you are granted access.Here's how you can create SSH keys on various operating systems:

If you have Git Bash installed, you can use the same command as above in the Git Bash terminal:

```bash

ssh-keygen -t rsa

```

Again, it will prompt you for a save location and passphrase.

Once you have generated your SSH keys, you can use the public key by copying its content and adding it to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server you want to connect to. The private key should be kept secure and not shared with others.

If you already have an existing id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub (public key) and you need to retrieve them, you can find them in the default SSH directory of your user account. Here's how to locate them:

Linux/MacOS: Open a terminal and navigate to the ~/.ssh/ directory, which is the default location for SSH keys. You can use the following command:

cd ~/.ssh/
Once you are in the ~/.ssh/ directory, you can see the files using the ls command:

ls
This will list all the files in the directory, including your id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub (public key).

Remember that SSH keys provide a secure way of authentication, but it's essential to protect your private key with a strong passphrase to ensure an additional layer of security.
