### 0x0D. Web Stack Debugging #0

**Introduction:**
Web stack debugging involves identifying and fixing issues within the various layers of a web application stack. A web stack typically includes the server, database, back-end application, and front-end code. Debugging requires understanding how these components interact and isolating the root cause of any problems.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Understanding the Web Stack:**
   - **Front-End:** The client-side part of a web application, usually involving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - **Back-End:** The server-side part, which handles business logic, database interactions, and server configuration.
   - **Database:** Where the application’s data is stored and managed.
   - **Server:** The machine that runs the back-end and serves the front-end to users.

2. **Common Tools and Commands:**
   - **SSH (Secure Shell):** Used to remotely access and manage servers.
   - **Docker:** A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
   - **Curl:** A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.
   - **Log Files:** Important for tracking down issues. Common log files include web server logs, application logs, and system logs.

3. **Typical Debugging Process:**
   - **Reproduce the Issue:** Ensure you can consistently reproduce the problem.
   - **Check Logs:** Look for error messages or unusual entries in log files.
   - **Isolate the Component:** Determine which part of the stack is causing the problem.
   - **Fix the Issue:** Apply the appropriate fix, which could involve code changes, configuration adjustments, or restarting services.
   - **Test the Fix:** Verify that the issue is resolved and no new problems are introduced.

**Example Scenario:**

Suppose you, Ugbana Adebisi Christiana, are tasked with debugging a web stack issue where a web application is not loading correctly.

### Steps to Debug the Issue:

1. **Access the Server:**
   - Use SSH to connect to the server:
     ```sh
     ssh username@server_ip
     ```

2. **Check the Web Server Status:**
   - Ensure that the web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) is running:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl status nginx
     ```

3. **Examine the Web Server Logs:**
   - Check the error log for any issues:
     ```sh
     sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/nginx/error.log
     ```

4. **Check the Application Logs:**
   - Look for errors in the application’s log files, typically located in the application's directory.

5. **Test the Web Application Locally:**
   - Use `curl` to test the web application from the server itself:
     ```sh
     curl -I http://localhost
     ```

6. **Check Database Connectivity:**
   - Ensure that the application can connect to the database. Verify the database service status:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl status mysql
     ```

7. **Inspect Docker Containers (if applicable):**
   - If the application is running in Docker containers, list the running containers and inspect their logs:
     ```sh
     docker ps
     docker logs container_id
     ```

### Example Debugging Session:

1. **Login to the Server:**
   ```sh
   ssh ugbana@192.168.1.1
   ```

2. **Check Nginx Status:**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status nginx
   ```
   - If Nginx is not running, start it:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     ```

3. **View Nginx Error Logs:**
   ```sh
   sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```
   - You might find an error like `502 Bad Gateway`, indicating an issue with the upstream server.

4. **Check Application Logs:**
   - Navigate to the application log directory and view the latest entries:
     ```sh
     cd /var/www/myapp/logs
     tail -n 50 app.log
     ```
   - You might find a database connection error.

5. **Verify Database Status:**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status mysql
   ```
   - If the database service is down, restart it:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl start mysql
     ```

6. **Test Application Connectivity:**
   ```sh
   curl -I http://localhost
   ```
   - Ensure that the application returns a `200 OK` status.

7. **Inspect Docker Containers (if using Docker):**
   ```sh
   docker ps
   docker logs myapp_container
   ```

### Conclusion:

Web stack debugging involves systematically checking each layer of the web stack to identify and fix issues. By following a structured approach and using common tools and commands, you can effectively debug problems and ensure your web application runs smoothly. Understanding how to access and interpret log files, test services, and manage server processes are essential skills for effective web stack debugging.
