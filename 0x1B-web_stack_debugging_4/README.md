tack
Front-End: This is what users interact with, typically including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Back-End: This handles business logic, databases, and server-side programming, such as using languages like PHP, Python, Node.js, or Ruby.
Database: This stores and manages the application's data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Server: The environment in which the web application runs, usually involving servers like Apache, Nginx, or cloud platforms like AWS.
2. Common Debugging Techniques
Inspecting the Front-End: Using browser developer tools to inspect elements, check the console for JavaScript errors, and track network requests.
Examining Logs: Checking server logs, database logs, or application logs for errors.
Testing the Database: Ensuring queries are executed correctly and no database connection issues arise.
Checking Server Configuration: Verifying that the server is set up correctly, ensuring the correct environment variables, security settings, and services are running properly.
Network Debugging: Using tools like curl, netcat, or Wireshark to test connectivity and identify network-related issues.
3. Automated Debugging Tools
Tools like lsof, strace, tcpdump, and ngrep can be useful in pinpointing where issues lie in the stack.
4. Sample Task
A typical project with this name might include tasks such as:

Fixing a broken web application.
Diagnosing slow performance in a web service.
Repairing issues with a database not communicating with the application server.
Resolving incorrect responses from the server (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).
Debugging authentication problems or broken API endpoints.
The "4" in the name may indicate that this is the fourth in a series of debugging tasks, where students progressively learn more complex debugging techniques related to the web stack.
