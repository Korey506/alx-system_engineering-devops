### 0x0F-load_balancer

This project involves learning about load balancers, which distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers. Key concepts and tasks include:

1. **Introduction to Load Balancing:** Understanding what load balancers are and their importance in managing traffic and ensuring high availability.
2. **Types of Load Balancers:** Learning about different types of load balancers such as hardware vs. software, and Layer 4 vs. Layer 7.
3. **Setting up Load Balancers:** Configuring and using tools like HAProxy to set up load balancing for web servers.
4. **Health Checks:** Implementing health checks to ensure traffic is only sent to healthy servers.
5. **Redundancy and Failover:** Ensuring that the system can handle failures by distributing traffic to other servers.

The project aims to provide practical experience in setting up and managing load balancers to improve the scalability and reliability of web applications.
