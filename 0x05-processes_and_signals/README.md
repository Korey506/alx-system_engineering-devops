Signals are the interrupts that are sent to the program to specify that an important event has occurred. Events can vary from user requests to invalid memory access errors. Various signals, like the interrupt signal, means that the user has asked the program to perform something which is not present in the user flow of control.There are various processes in different states in the Linux computer system. All these processes belong to either the operating system or the user application. A mechanism is required for the kernel and these processes to coordinate their activities. One method to perform this, for the process, to inform others if anything vital occurs. That's the reason we have signals.

Basically, the signal means a one-way notification. The kernel sent the signal to the process, to one process to itself, or another process.
Linux signals trace their origin to Unix signals. In later Linus versions, real-time signals were added. Signal inter process is an easy and lightweight form of communication and is therefore compatible with embedded systems.
