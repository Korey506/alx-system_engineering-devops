**0x0E. Web Stack Debugging #1** is a project in the Holberton School curriculum focused on diagnosing and fixing issues within a web stack. Here's a breakdown of what it involves:

### Objective:
The main goal is to debug a web stack, which is a combination of technologies (such as servers, databases, and application frameworks) used to build and run web applications.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Web Stack Components**: Understanding the different layers of a web stack, including web servers (like Nginx or Apache), application servers, and databases.
2. **Debugging Tools**: Learning to use various tools and commands to identify and resolve issues. This includes using `curl` to test HTTP requests, checking logs, and using system commands to inspect running processes.
3. **Common Issues**: Identifying typical problems that can occur in a web stack, such as server misconfigurations, network issues, or application errors.
4. **System Administration**: Gaining experience in managing and troubleshooting servers, understanding service management (starting, stopping, and restarting services), and checking system resource usage.
5. **Scripting**: Writing scripts to automate the debugging process and ensure that the web stack is running smoothly.

### Tasks:
- **Task 0: Strace is your friend**: This involves using the `strace` command to debug an issue. `strace` is a diagnostic tool that logs all system calls made by a process. The task requires identifying why a web server is not starting properly and fixing the issue.

### Approach:
1. **Identify the Problem**: Use debugging tools and techniques to determine the root cause of the issue.
2. **Analyze Logs**: Check server logs and system logs for error messages and clues.
3. **Inspect Configurations**: Review configuration files for web servers, databases, and other components to ensure they are correctly set up.
4. **Test Fixes**: Implement solutions and test to ensure the issue is resolved.
5. **Document Findings**: Keep a record of the problem and the steps taken to fix it for future reference.

### Skills Developed:
- Proficiency in using debugging tools and commands.
- Ability to diagnose and fix web stack issues.
- Understanding of web server and application server configurations.
- Experience with system administration tasks.

This project is essential for developing problem-solving skills in a real-world web stack environment and prepares students for handling similar issues in their professional careers.
